iPyRAD commands: Data were run at two separate facilities. Identical barcodes were used
in the library preparations, so libraries must be demultiplexed separately.

# Create 2 new assemblies:
ipyrad -n erisor1
ipyrad -n erisor2          

# After editing "params-erisor1.txt" and "params-erisor2.txt" run the first step (demultiplex):
ipyrad -p params-erisor1.txt -s 1
ipyrad -p params-erisor2.txt -s 1

# Merge the two assemblies.
ipyrad -m erisor params-erisor1.txt params-erisor2.txt

# Edit params-erisor1.txt
# Finish the remaining data assembly steps with the merged data.
ipyrad -p params-erisor.txt -s 234567

# To branch E. shockleyi into a separate assembly:
ipyrad -p params-erisor.txt -b shockleyi shockleyi_samples.txt

# After editing params-shockleyi.txt, run the branch:
ipyrad -p params-shockleyi.txt -s 234567
