#   genotypes = 244  (number of samples) This number can be found in the ipyrad _stats file, I had 266 but I threw out two samples with no data.
#   markers = 1886 (number of loci) Also find in ipyrad _stats file.
#   column with labels for genotypes = 1 (the names of the samples)
#   column with population factor = 0 (if we were specifying populations a priori but we aren't)
#   other optional columns - just hit enter, there are none in our data
#   row with the marker names = 0 (We don't have a marker names row)
#   genotypes coded by a single row = n (We have 2 lines per sample in the dataset.)
