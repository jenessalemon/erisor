	Looking at the histogram (177_shock_hist.PDF) the dot (representing the correlation between
the genetic and geographic distances) falls outside the bounds of the histogram (of 
simulated values without the influence of spatial structure). This time I can see an 
isolation by distance pattern. The p-value for this run was 0.001, meaning that there is
a .1% chance that we would get this result based solely on chance. 
	Since I suspect an IDB pattern, I move on to examine the heat map produced (177_shock_heat.PDF),
to determine whether the correlation is occurring due to a continuous cline of genetic
differentiation, or distant patches. The heat map reveals two distinct patches.
