Plate 2 (DNA sequenced at Berkeley), 36 individuals of E. shockleyi.

Monte-Carlo test
Call: mantel.randtest(m1 = D2, m2 = Dgeo2)

Observation: -0.06084527 

Based on 999 replicates
Simulated p-value: 0.903            
Alternative hypothesis: greater 

     Std.Obs  Expectation     Variance 
-1.233485584  0.001339597  0.002541565 

	Looking at the histogram (p2shockhist.PDF) the dot represents the actual correlation
between my genetic and geographic distance matrices. The histogram represents simulated
values (without the influence of spatial structure.) Because the dot falls well within
the bounds of the histogram, isolation by distance is not clearly significant. In 
addition, a p-value of .903 means that there is a 90.3% chance that I could get these 
results based on chance alone. (That’s a pretty good chance!)
	When analyzing these results it is important to remember that these data are, based 
on the neighbor joining trees that they produce, highly inaccurate and random. I would NOT 
assume that there is no IBD pattern seen in E. shockleyi because of this result. Rather,
because of the quality of the data, the results are inconclusive.

Plate 3 (DNA sequenced at Berkeley), 25 individuals of E. shockleyi.

Monte-Carlo test
Call: mantel.randtest(m1 = D3, m2 = Dgeo3)

Observation: -0.1180307 

Based on 999 replicates
Simulated p-value: 0.905 
Alternative hypothesis: greater 

     Std.Obs  Expectation     Variance 
-1.296882994  0.002050265  0.008573277

	Looking at the histogram (p3shockhist.PDF) I’m not terribly surprised that it is similar
to the result for plate 2 (as those library preparations were done on the same day, by me.)
Again, because the dot falls well within the bounds of the histogram, isolation by distance
is not clearly significant. A p-value of .905 means that there is a 90.5% chance that I 
could get these results based on chance alone. As with the last section, these results are
inconclusive based on the quality of the data for plate 3.

Plates 4 and 5 (DNA sequenced at Wisconsin), 89 individuals of E. shockleyi.

Monte-Carlo test
Call: mantel.randtest(m1 = D45, m2 = Dgeo45)

Observation: 0.2217856 

Based on 999 replicates
Simulated p-value: 0.001 
Alternative hypothesis: greater 

     Std.Obs  Expectation     Variance 
4.9419607956 0.0005367456 0.0020043043 

	Looking at the histogram (p45shockhist.PDF) the dot (representing the correlation between
the genetic and geographic distances) falls outside the bounds of the histogram (of 
simulated values without the influence of spatial structure). This time I can see an 
isolation by distance pattern. The p-value for this run was 0.001, meaning that there is
a .1% chance that we would get this result based solely on chance. 
	Since I suspect an IDB pattern, I move on to examine the heat map produced (p45shockheat.PDF),
to determine whether the correlation is occurring due to a continuous cline of genetic
differentiation, or distant patches. The heat map reveals two distinct patches. 
This is interesting- I would expect this if I had E. shockleyi AND E. soredium in the mix,
but these input files only have individuals of E. shockleyi. I’m not sure how to interpret
the two groups, but if I had to guess, I would say that the two patches represent northern
vs. southern regions of shockleyi. The plant differs (phenotypically) quite a bit across 
it’s range, and the dry, light colored, crusty soil it is found growing on in the north is
quite different from the red, sandy soil it is found on in the south. But at this point
I’m just giving my best guess.
